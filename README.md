## Java-Project-Election
### Project explanation
"It is a system for managing elections while synchronizing processes and using Threads for voting in sample surveys.

The system is designed to handle and manage various aspects of elections, such as voter registration, creating and editing voter lists, managing votes, and counting the ballots. Additionally, it ensures control over voting processes and ensures the security and uniqueness of each given vote.

The system utilizes threading technology to facilitate the voting process in sample surveys. When participating in a sample survey, the purpose of using threads is to enable quick and coordinated responses for numerous users simultaneously. Each participant can vote almost simultaneously without waiting for other users' voting to conclude.

The system efficiently manages resources, enhancing performance and efficiency during the voting process and continuous management of the elections. This approach prevents unresponsiveness or problems on the server from external influences.

The threading structure also allows for parallel management of processes, both for servers and clients. Through threads, conflicts and competition over shared resources are avoided, ensuring high availability and efficiency in all processes.

Overall, the system aims to simplify election management, ensuring smooth, secure, and fast processes. It seeks to improve democratic procedures and public perception regarding voting actions and surveys."
